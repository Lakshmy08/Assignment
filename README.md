# Assignment Website

This is the repository for the **Assignment** website hosted at [lakshmy08.github.io/Assignment](https://lakshmy08.github.io/Assignment/). The website provides an interactive form for collecting user information such as their name, email, phone number, and a message.

## Features

- **Interactive Form**: The website features a contact form that includes fields for:
  - First Name
  - Email
  - Phone Number
  - Message
- **Form Validation**: Basic validation is implemented to ensure that all required fields are filled before the form can be submitted.
- **User Feedback**: After submitting the form, the user is greeted with a thank you message that includes their first name.

## Files in the Repository

- **index.html**: The main HTML file that contains the structure of the website.
- **style.css**: Contains the styling for the website to make it visually appealing.
- **port.js**: JavaScript file that handles form validation and user feedback on form submission.

## How It Works

1. The user fills out the contact form by providing their first name, email address, phone number, and an optional message.
2. When the user clicks the submit button, the form is validated using the JavaScript file `port.js`.
3. If all required fields are filled, a thank you alert is displayed with the user's first name. If not, an alert asks the user to complete the required fields.

## How to Use
